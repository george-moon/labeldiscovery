## Requirements

The app requires a spotify premium account to link with the spotify API and use the app.

## Features!
```
Allows the users to browse all album releases for a curated list of record labels. All the information is pulled from the spotify API.

Results can be sorted by various criteria. Most importantly you can search for album releases within the last month / 3 months / 6 months / all releases.

Users can add a label to a "watchlist". This feature records the users selections and adds all the record labels to a watchlist section which can also be sorted.
